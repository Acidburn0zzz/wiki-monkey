Wiki Monkey is a MediaWiki-compatible bot and editor assistant that can be used
directly within wiki pages in the browser as a user script. Currently it is
tested on Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Opera, but it is very likely to
work also on other browsers out of the box or with minor adaptations. Wiki
Monkey can also be easily extended through the creation of plugins, exploiting
its API.
