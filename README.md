Wiki Monkey is a MediaWiki-compatible bot and editor assistant that can be used
directly within wiki pages in the browser as a user script. It is developed and
tested on Firefox, and designed to work also on Chrome/Chromium and Opera, for
which full support is given; it is very likely to work also on other browsers
out of the box or with minor adaptations.
